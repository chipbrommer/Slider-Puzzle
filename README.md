# Slider-Puzzle

Created for USM Computer Science CSC 413. 

This program was created for use of academic purposes. Feel free to use as desired but please give credit. 

This is a basic C++ program that will solve a 9 number slider puzzle using A.I. algorithms. At start the user is given the ability to Enter a puzzle, Upload a puzzle, Select a premade puzzle, or have a puzzle randomly generated. The puzzle will be displayed to the user and then the user will be presented with a solving options menu. This menu gives the user the ability to select from a Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, A* Misplaced Tiles Search, and A* Manhatten Distance Search. The user can select a sorting algorithm. The solved puzzle will be displayed with the time taken to solve. The user is also given the ability to print each move of the puzzle. This would be printed in a nice 3x3 puzzle view. The user can then choose to re-use the same puzzle with a different algorithm, go back to main, or exit the program. As expected, depending on the complexity of the puzzle, the BFS and DFS take an extended amount of time to solve. For this type of A.I. the Manhatten Distance and the Misplaced Tiles are much better. 

The entire console is printed to a convenient txt file for the user to use as desired.
